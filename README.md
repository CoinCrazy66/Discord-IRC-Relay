This project is a simple Discord/IRC bot that relays irc messages to and from a Discord channel. This bot's goal is to provide a bridge between IRC channels and Discord text channels as seemlessly as possible.

## Installation
- Build the project or [download from our releases page](https://github.com/Headline22/Discord-IRC-Relay/releases)
- Configure Settings.xml
- Ensure Settings.xml is alongside the executable
- Run the executable!

## Credits 
Much of the code was adapted from [VoiDeD's bot](https://github.com/VoiDeD/steam-irc-bot/), so many thanks for the guidance. Also I'd like to thank the guys on #opensteamworks in gamesurge irc.
