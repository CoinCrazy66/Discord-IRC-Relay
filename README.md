# Discord-IRC-Relay
A Discord bot that relays irc messages to a Discord channel. This bot's goal is to provide a bridge between IRC channels and Discord text channels as seemlessly as possible. As the time of writing, this bot does not send messages to IRC. This will change in the future.

## Installation
- Build the project or [download from our releases page](https://github.com/Headline22/Discord-IRC-Relay/releases)
- Configure Settings.xml
- Ensure Settings.xml is alongside the executable
- Run the executable!
